; ntc_lib_msx.asm - MSX-DOS 2 / Nextor platform banking (msxdos)
; (c) 2026 Cyborg Unicorn Pty Ltd - MIT License
; ------------------------------------------------------------
; The MSX versions of the banking primitives the CPC-modelled Memory
; manager (ntc_mem, in ntc_lib_cpc.asm) switches platform on, as the
; Next's are in ntc_lib_nxt.asm:
;   msx_mem_probe   - the mapper's segments (mem_probe's MSX branch)
;   msx_mem_jbc     - 64K bank -> its page 0's RAM setting (mem_jbc's)
;   msx_mem_se_out  - a RAM setting into the window #4000-#7FFF (mem_se_out's)
;   msx_win         - the same for a program's own asm (CyborgOS), as out (c), c
;   msx_mem_bank    - a RAM setting -> its segment
; The whole section is IFDEF NTC_MSXDOS: nothing on any other platform.
;
; The mapper's 16K segments come from MSX-DOS 2's mapper support (EXTBIO
; #FFCA, D = 4, E = 2: the jump table): ALL_SEG takes every free user segment
; of the primary mapper at the probe (MSX-DOS 2 frees them when the program
; ends), 4 a 64K "bank" in the order given (a bank's 4 needn't be next to each
; other: its segments are looked up, msx_segs). The window is page 1, changed
; with PUT_P1 so that MSX-DOS 2 knows what is in it (a BDOS call reading into
; the window reads into that segment). Main RAM's own page 1 (the setting
; #7FC0) is the segment the program started with (GET_P1).
;
; The RAM setting (BC) is shaped as the CPC's gate-array one, as on the Next,
; so that the CPC's setting arithmetic (a bank's "C2" setting = its page 0's
; and #F8 or 2; its page n in the window = and #F8 or 4 + n) works unchanged:
; B = MSX_SETB (1 - never 0, never #7F), C = the bank's ordinal * 8 + 4 + its
; page (0-3), or + 2 for the whole bank.
